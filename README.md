# random-cogs
A collections of some random discord.py cogs that I've made, might be helpful for someone.
I've included a bare-bones class-based bot as well, for quick usage.
Make sure to make a `config.ini` file in the same format as `sample_config.ini` with your bot token!
You'll also need to install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Current cogs
- blender: a cog that's a clone of CLC's barista
- button: The Button! A game where you try to have the most amount of time between when you push the button and the last person that pushed the button.
